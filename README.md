JavaScript utilities for use with the [Ninchat](https://ninchat.com) API.


NinchatClient
-------------

- `src/ninchatclient/` contains Go sources for NinchatClient, a library for
  accessing `api.ninchat.com` from a web browser.  It is a thin wrapper on the
  [`ninchat-go`](https://github.com/ninchat/ninchat-go) package (referenced as
  a Git submodule).

- `gen/ninchatclient.js` contains JavaScript sources generated with
  [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).  Regenerate with `make`
  (requires [Go](https://golang.org)).  The latest stable version is available
  at `https://ninchat.com/js/ninchatclient.js` and
  `https://ninchat.com/js/ninchatclient.min.js`.

- [`doc/ninchatclient.md`](doc/ninchatclient.md) contains API
  documentation.

- `example/client-test.js` demonstrates usage.

NinchatClient supports IE8 and later, but the code generated by GopherJS
requires ES5 and typed array shims.  When WebSocket transport is not available,
NinchatClient doesn't actually use the typed arrays, so stubs are enough.


NinchatModel
------------

- `src/ninchatmodel/` contains Go sources for NinchatModel; a wrapper on the
  `ninchat-go/ninchatapi` and `ninchat-go/ninchatmodel` packages.  Its API is a
  superset of NinchatClient.

- `gen/ninchatmodel.js` contains generated JavaScript sources.

- [`doc/ninchatmodel.md`](doc/ninchatmodel.md) contains API documentation.

- `example/model-test.js` demonstrates usage.
